# Evently Page Implementation Plan

Author: Claude
Date: 2025-08-07

This implementation plan describes the registration page for the Evently application. New users will be able to create an account by providing their email and choosing a password.

The page will contain a centered registration form with email and password fields, password confirmation, a submit button, and a link to the login page for existing users.

## 1 - Components

### 1.1 - Component `RegistrationForm`

A form component that handles new user registration.

**Components used:**
- Form container
- Email input field
- Password input field
- Password confirmation input field
- Submit button
- Link to login page
- Success/Error message display

**Position on the page:**
- Centered both horizontally and vertically on the page
- Maximum width of 400px for optimal readability

**Data and API correlation:**
- Uses `POST /auth/register` endpoint (to be created)
- Sends registration data:
  - `email`: User's email
  - `password`: User's chosen password

**Detailed style:**
- Clean, modern form design matching the login page
- Input fields with labels and placeholders
- Password fields with masked input
- Password strength indicator (optional)
- Primary styled submit button
- Success messages in green, error messages in red
- Link to login page styled as secondary text

**Actions:**
- On form submit: Validate all inputs, call register API
- On successful registration: Show success message, optionally auto-login
- On error: Display error message (email taken, validation errors)
- On "Login" link click: Navigate to login page

### 1.2 - Component `PasswordStrengthIndicator` (optional)

Visual indicator showing password strength to guide users.

**Components used:**
- Progress bar or strength meter
- Text hints for password requirements

**Position on the page:**
- Below the password input field
- Appears dynamically as user types

**Data displayed:**
- Password strength level (weak, medium, strong)
- Requirements checklist (length, special characters, etc.)

**Detailed style:**
- Color-coded indicator (red, yellow, green)
- Small text for requirements
- Smooth transitions between states

### 1.3 - Assumptions about components

- 1.3.1: Password confirmation field validates matching passwords client-side
- 1.3.2: Email validation includes format checking before submission
- 1.3.3: The form shows real-time validation feedback as users type
- 1.3.4: After successful registration, users can be automatically logged in

## 2 - Business rules

### 2.1 - (user) `rule-auth-registration-flow`

Users should be able to register and then login. Registration requires email and password.

### 2.2 - (inferred) `rule-auth-password-requirements`

Passwords should meet minimum security requirements:
- Minimum 8 characters length
- Should contain mix of characters for security

### 2.3 - (inferred) `rule-auth-email-uniqueness`

Each email address can only be registered once. Duplicate registration attempts should show appropriate error message.

### 2.4 - (inferred) `rule-auth-auto-login-option`

After successful registration, the system may automatically log the user in and redirect to home page, or show a success message with a link to login.

### 2.5 - (inferred) `rule-auth-default-role`

New users registered through the public registration form receive the "user" role by default. Admin role can only be assigned through the admin interface.
